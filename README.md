Version 2.1

Copyright © 2015 Autodesk, Inc. All rights reserved.

###Repository Overview
The [Autodesk Ember](https://ember.autodesk.com/) 3D printer uses the firmware here to control its operation and communicate with applications.  The components in the C++ and ruby folders run on the main (Sitara) processor under Linux and the others run on two satelite AVRs that control the motors and front panel.

###Development Image
An image of the SD card we use for development can be downloaded from [here](http://printer-firmware.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/development_image).  To use it, flash it to a micro SD card (2GB minimum), boot a BeagleBone Black or an Ember using the SD card, then ssh in (root@192.168.7.2 via network over USB) and run:

```
resize-rootfs
reboot
```
